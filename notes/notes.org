* Data
** Hyperlinks

Cedars-Sinai dataset. See [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362074][Machine learning approaches to analyze
histological images of tissues from radical prostatectomies]] for more
details about the curation, annotation and so on.

** Description

There are 225 images. In this analysis, they are tiled with a stride
of tile length / 2. The class is selected from the center pixel
(rounded down if length is even). Experiments are run with patch sizes
of 32, 64, 128.

AT masks are used. There are 4 pixel-wise classes in this data.

The AT masks correspond to pathologist labelling: 0,1,2,3 corresponds
to yellow, red, blue, green (see color annotated images) which
corresponds to stroma, high grade tumor, benign/normal, low grade
tumor.

| 0 | Y | stroma        |
| 1 | R | high grade    |
| 2 | B | benign/normal |
| 3 | G | low grade     |

* Model
  
ResNet model with bottleneck blocks. 

There are 4 bottleneck groups, each one hsa 3 bottleneck blocks, each
block has 3 layers --- an expansion layer which does 1x1 convolution
with a filter size of 128, 256, 512, and 1024 for each group, a
bottleneck layer which does 3x3 convolution with the same number of
filters and a 3x3 convolution with the number of filters set to the
input of the bottleneck block so that dimensions match for the
residual connection.

In total there are $4 \times 3 \times 3 = 36$ layers.

* Results
  
See ipython notebooks for more.

* Research and Benchmarks

# What is the meaning of a 4 class mask as in the AT Mask? What is the
# different between AT masks and the ST GL masks? How does this
# correspond to the Cedars-Sinai paper?

Should I use Jaccard index as well even though it seems wrong and
somewhat convoluted?

* Next Steps

- confusion matrix
- overlay of predictions --> stride of 1
- segmentation by classification
- fully convolutional neural networks
- predict percentage?
- predict grade? predict high-low?
- other datasets (MSK data)
- eventually need to talk to a pathologist
