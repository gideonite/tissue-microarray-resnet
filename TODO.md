Software
========

Let's clean up this code.

Upgrade TF version.

Am I using cudnn??

Feedback
========

Try a high learning rate (1.0).

Do the stuff for validation (confusion matrix, learning curves, etc.)

Go through the architectures again. Get the dimensions right in your head!

What can I do with this code eventually?

Future Work
===========

Think more about this.

2 labels. 1 layer. stroma vs one thing.

16 x 16
32 x 32
64 x 64

128 x 128 regression

set learning rate to 1

cross validation!
